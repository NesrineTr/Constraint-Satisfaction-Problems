# Constraint-Satisfaction-Problems
This project solves the Map Coloring Problem using Answer Set Programming (ASP) with Clingo and compares it to a previous solution using Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) in Prolog and Python. It explores the efficiency, elegance, and adaptability of both approaches in coloring maps without adjacent regions sharing colors.

✔️Task 1: Map Coloring in ASP
Implement the map coloring problem in ASP using Clingo. This will involve defining constraints to ensure adjacent regions do not share the same color.

✔️Task 2: Painting the Australian Map
Apply the ASP solution to color the map of Australia, which includes territories and states like New South Wales, Victoria, etc.

✔️Task 3: Analyze Your Solution
Evaluate the elegance and efficiency of the ASP implementation compared to the previous solution in CLP.

✔️Task 4: Color the Whole World!
Extend the solution to color a map of the entire world. This increases the complexity due to the larger number of regions and constraints.

✔️Task 5: Compare ASP vs CLP
Compare the performance (in terms of execution time) and the expressiveness of the ASP solution with the previous CLP-based approach in Prolog and Python.

✔️Task 6: Elaboration Tolerance
Examine how well the ASP solution adapts to changes, such as modifying the constraints or adding new rules, and compare this to CLP.

✔️Task 7: Count Countries
Add a feature to count the number of regions/countries that were successfully colored.

✔️Task 8: Clingo + Python Integration
Demonstrate how Clingo can be integrated with Python for more advanced processing or visualization.
