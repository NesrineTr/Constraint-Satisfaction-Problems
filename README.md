# Constraint-Satisfaction-Problems
This project solves the Map Coloring Problem using Answer Set Programming (ASP) with Clingo and compares it to a previous solution using Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) in Prolog and Python. It explores the efficiency, elegance, and adaptability of both approaches in coloring maps without adjacent regions sharing colors.
